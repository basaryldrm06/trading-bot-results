## Description

This repository showcases the results of five previously developed buy-sell trading bots and compares their performances. Each bot has its dedicated section, containing source code, configuration details, and comprehensive README files explaining strategies.

This repository is created with the purpose of detailing how these bots are developed, presenting their results, and comparing them with each other to determine which one performs better.
